## 🧠 Learning Focus
This project was created as part of my exploration into animation libraries and frontend motion design. I’m currently diving deeper into:

- **GSAP** advanced features (ScrollTrigger, Timelines)
- **three.js** for integrating 3D elements and scenes
- Motion UI design principles
- Performance optimization with React & Vite
